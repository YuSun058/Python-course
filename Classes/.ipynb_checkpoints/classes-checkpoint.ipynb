    "So a property looks like a regular attribute from outside, but internally it has two methods that we call a getter and a setter. While this price property solves our problem, the two methods we wrote are still accessible. That is, if we type `product.`, we can still see `get_price` and `set_price` methods. These methods are poluting the interface of our object. We want our classes, or objects to have minimal number of functions or methods exposed to the outside. To hide these, one solution is to make them private by double underscore. A better way to achieve the same result is to use a decorator. Earlier we use a decorator, called class method `@classmethod` to convert an instance method to a class method. We have another decorator for creating a property. "

We don't want to do a value error, because here we're not dealing with a value. In this example, we can create a custom exception called InvalidOperationError. We don't have this in Python. So, on the top, let's create another class InvalidOperationError. We want to derive this from the base exception class in Python. So everytime you want to create a custom exception, you should write your class from the exception class. Here we don't need any code, so we simply add a pass statement.

The first issue is that we can create a stream object and call the open method. Why is this an issue? Because this stream class is an abstract concept. What does it mean to open a stream? We shouldn't be able to directly create an instance of the stream class. We should always subclass it and then create an instance of the subclass. **So we only create this stream class as a base class to provide some code that we're going to reuse across different kinds of streams.** Now the second issue. If you look at the implementaion of the file stream and network stream classes, you can see both these classes have a read method. If tomorrow we decide to create a different kind of stream, we should remember to implement this read method, call it exactly read. If you call it read line or read str or read whatever, it's not going to be consistent with the other kinds of streams we have here. In other words, currently there is no way to enforce a common interface across different kinds of streams. This is more of a convention we have used here. **It would be nice to have a common contract or common interface across these different types of streams.** So how can we solve these problems? That's when we use an **abstract base class**. \n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract base class is like a half baked cookie. Its purpose is to provide some common code to its derivatives. So here we want to make this stream class an abstract base class. To do that, we go on the top, and from abc module, which stands for abstract base class, we import the ABC class and abstract method function, which we are going to use as a decorator. The name of the module is all lowercase, and the name of the class is all uppercase. "

    "So using this approach, we can render the user interface of an application. Imagine you have a form with a bunch of text boxes, drop down lists, radio buttons and so on. You could have a list of all these objects, and pass that list to a function like draw. That function would take care of rendering the entire form. What is interesting here, is that our draw function doesn't know what kind of control it's working with. This is determined at run time. It simply iterates over the list of controls and calls the draw method of each control object. This is what we call **polymorphism**. \"Poly\" means many, \"morph\" means forms. So **polymorphism means many forms**. In this example, our draw method is taking many different forms, and this is determined at run time.  "

We're going to call that Point. Now as a second argument, we pass an array of attribute names. So this returns a named tuple that we can store. Name it to Point, which represents a type, like a class. So we can call it to create new point objects p1 and p2. However, instead of passing numbers only, we should pass keyword arguments. \n",

    "The first improvement here is that our code is more clear and less ambiguous. We don't have to wonder what are these values. It's easy to guess 1 and 2 represent x and y here. The second benefit is that we don't have to explicitly implement a magic method to compare two objects."

You will write less code, and these named tuples are better than regular tuples, because here we'll have attributes in this Point object just like the attributes we have in our classes. So if we print `p1.x`, we see 1.\n",
